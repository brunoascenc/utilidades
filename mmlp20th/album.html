              <h3>The Marshall Mathers LP</h3>
              <p>
                After breaking out in 1999 with the Grammy-winning and
                multi-Platinum The Slim Shady LP, Detroit MC Eminem had high
                expectations for his follow-up album, The Marshall Mathers LP,
                which dropped 19 years ago today. Eminem excelled under the
                pressure, channeling his anger into lyrics aimed at his critics,
                then-wife, and mother. The album won him a second straight
                Grammy for Best Rap Album while earning critical acclaim and
                breaking multiple sales records. However, it also drew
                controversy from politicians and GLAAD over his lyrics, which
                were deemed misogynist and homophobic. Dr. Dre handled the
                majority of the production on The Marshall Mathers LP and was
                assisted by Mel-Man. Eminem and his longtime collaborators, the
                Bass Brothers, produced the rest of the songs—with the exception
                of “Stan,” which is credited to DJ Mark the 45 King. Featured
                guests include Eminem’s longtime crew D12, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg,
                Xzibit, Nate Dogg, Sticky Fingaz, RBX, and British
                singer-songerwriter Dido, whose vocals are featured on “Stan.”

            <p>
              In the tradition of most of Eminem’s follow-up singles, “The Way I
              Am” features a much darker and emotionally driven sound than the
              album’s lead single, “The Real Slim Shady”. However, “The Way I
              Am” was actually recorded before “The Real Slim Shady”, as a
              direct result of the record company putting pressure on Em to
              create a poppy first single for the album.

            <span class="lyrics">"I don't know, that's just the way I am"</span> -->
            <p>
              In this song, Eminem corresponds with a crazed fan who becomes
              increasingly unhinged as the story progresses. Eminem intended for
              this song to be a message to fans who had written him disturbing
              letters indicating that they had taken The Slim Shady LP’s violent
              lyrics seriously.

              When Eminem originally handed his magnum opus, The Marshall
              Mathers LP, into Interscope, Jimmy Iovine stated “the album was
              spectacular… they needed a song to introduce the album”.
              Frustrated, Eminem felt he couldn’t produce another “My Name Is”,
              yet he was under pressure, so he began rush recording tracks, but
              instead of crafting a formulaic single, he recorded “The Way I
              Am”. Just prior to the deadline, Eminem got back in the studio
              with Dr. Dre and they swiftly crafted what became the album’s lead
              single.
