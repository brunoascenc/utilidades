              <h3>The <span>Marshall Mathers</span> LP</h3>
                <p>
                  After breaking out in 1999 with the Grammy-winning and
                  multi-Platinum The Slim Shady LP, Detroit MC Eminem had high
                  expectations for his follow-up album, The Marshall Mathers LP,
                  which dropped 20 years ago today. Eminem excelled under the
                  pressure, channeling his anger into lyrics aimed at his critics,
                  then-wife, and mother. The album won him a second straight
                  Grammy for Best Rap Album while earning critical acclaim and
                  breaking multiple sales records. However, it also drew
                  controversy from politicians and GLAAD over his lyrics, which
                  were deemed misogynist and homophobic.

            <h2>The way i am</h2>
            <p>
              In the tradition of most of Eminem’s follow-up singles, “The Way I
              Am” features a much darker and emotionally driven sound than the
              album’s lead single, “The Real Slim Shady”. However, “The Way I
              Am” was actually recorded before “The Real Slim Shady”, as a
              direct result of the record company putting pressure on Em to
              create a poppy first single for the album.

              In this song, Eminem corresponds with a crazed fan who becomes
              increasingly unhinged as the story progresses. Eminem intended for
              this song to be a message to fans who had written him disturbing
              letters indicating that they had taken The Slim Shady LP’s violent
              lyrics seriously.

            <p>"So will the real Shady please stand up"</p>
            <h2>The Real Slim Shady</h2>
            <p>
              When Eminem originally handed his magnum opus, The Marshall
              Mathers LP, into Interscope, Jimmy Iovine stated “the album was
              spectacular… they needed a song to introduce the album”.
              Frustrated, Eminem felt he couldn’t produce another “My Name Is”,
              yet he was under pressure, so he began rush recording tracks, but
              instead of crafting a formulaic single, he recorded “The Way I
              Am”. Just prior to the deadline, Eminem got back in the studio
              with Dr. Dre and they swiftly crafted what became the album’s lead
              single.
