            <h3>The Marshall Mathers LP</h3>
            <p>
              After breaking out in 1999 with the Grammy-winning and
              multi-Platinum The Slim Shady LP, Detroit MC Eminem had high
              expectations for his follow-up album, The Marshall Mathers LP,
              which dropped 19 years ago today. Eminem excelled under the
              pressure, channeling his anger into lyrics aimed at his critics,
              then-wife, and mother. The album won him a second straight Grammy
              for Best Rap Album while earning critical acclaim and breaking
              multiple sales records. However, it also drew controversy from
              politicians and GLAAD over his lyrics, which were deemed
              misogynist and homophobic. Dr. Dre handled the majority of the
              production on The Marshall Mathers LP and was assisted by Mel-Man.
              Eminem and his longtime collaborators, the Bass Brothers, produced
              the rest of the songs—with the exception of “Stan,” which is
              credited to DJ Mark the 45 King. Featured guests include Eminem’s
              longtime crew D12, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Xzibit, Nate Dogg, Sticky
              Fingaz, RBX, and British singer-songerwriter Dido, whose vocals
              are featured on “Stan.”
